# üìß Direct Email Setup Guide

Your contact form now sends emails directly to `myca.anise@gmail.com` without any third-party apps or user intervention!

## How It Works

- ‚úÖ **No popups** - Messages are sent automatically
- ‚úÖ **No email client needed** - Works entirely through the website
- ‚úÖ **Direct delivery** - Emails go straight to your Gmail inbox
- ‚úÖ **Professional formatting** - HTML emails with your branding
- ‚úÖ **Secure** - Server-side email sending with authentication

## Setup Required

To enable direct email sending, you need to configure Gmail authentication:

### Step 1: Enable Gmail App Passwords

1. Go to your Google Account settings: https://myaccount.google.com/
2. Click **Security** in the left sidebar
3. Under "How you sign in to Google", click **2-Step Verification** (enable if not already)
4. Once 2-Step Verification is enabled, go back to Security
5. Under "How you sign in to Google", click **App passwords**
6. Select **Mail** and **Other (Custom name)**
7. Enter "Portfolio Contact Form" as the name
8. Copy the generated 16-character password (you'll need this)

### Step 2: Create Environment File

Create a `.env.local` file in your project root with:

```bash
# Gmail Configuration for Direct Email Sending
GMAIL_USER=myca.anise@gmail.com
GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD=your_16_character_app_password_here

# Optional: Your site URL for email footers
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

**Important**: Replace `your_16_character_app_password_here` with the actual app password from Step 1.

### Step 3: Test the Setup

1. Start your development server: `npm run dev`
2. Go to the contact form
3. Fill out and submit a test message
4. Check your Gmail inbox for the email

## Email Format

Emails will arrive in your inbox with:
- **Subject**: "Portfolio Contact: [their subject]"
- **From**: Your Gmail address (myca.anise@gmail.com)
- **To**: myca.anise@gmail.com
- **Content**: Professional HTML format with contact details and message

## Security Features

- ‚úÖ **App Password**: Uses Gmail App Passwords (not your main password)
- ‚úÖ **Server-side**: Email sending happens on your server, not in the browser
- ‚úÖ **Validation**: All form fields are validated before sending
- ‚úÖ **Rate limiting**: Built-in protection against spam

## Troubleshooting

### "Failed to send email" Error
- Check that `.env.local` exists and has correct values
- Verify Gmail App Password is correct (16 characters, no spaces)
- Ensure 2-Step Verification is enabled on your Google account

### Emails Not Arriving
- Check your Gmail spam folder
- Verify the app password was generated correctly
- Make sure `GMAIL_USER` matches your Gmail address exactly

### Development vs Production
- **Development**: Uses `http://localhost:3000` in email footers
- **Production**: Update `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` to your actual domain
